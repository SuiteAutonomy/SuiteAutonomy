An autonomous business class escrow solution Dapp

If you like smart contracts written in solidity you are very welcome cuz because thats what am being made of. 

The Aim is to solve Dex and traditional escrow by use of smart contract technology. Also may be competing with existing projects.

The belief is real that ethereum's platform has the potential to host autonomous applications that solves real world problems. Aiming to be part of the first that does. Suite Autonomy will provide solutions that will be of benefit.

Begining with Etherdelta a well known Decentralized Exchange (DEX) for erc20 tokens. We are enabling the proceedings from fees collected by etherdelta to be shared amongst the RICO token holders. We also adjusted the fee of the sourcecode to 0.05%.

P.s I am a user of the etherdelta platform and I really like it alot. It's only natural to try to improve on thier success.
